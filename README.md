This is an attempt to use "extreme programming" in scientific
computing. 

## Extreme Programming's Creation Myth

The roots of extreme programming came from Smalltalk, where
its users were trying to "live within the system". Towards that end,
Smalltalk programmers turned API specifications into executable unit
tests, and so on.

Rather than "copy the rituals", I am trying to go back to the _roots_
which inspired the rituals of extreme programming.

Alan F. Blackwell discusses in Chapter 7 of his book _Moral Codes: Designing Alternatives to AI_
many examples where Smalltalk developers "living in" the Smalltalk
system gave us many things we took for granted: unit testing, design
patterns, wikis, and so on.

## Why "WSmith"?

Go read Orwell's _1984_.
